# it throws an error because the getter method for serial_number is private, meaning that other instance cannot access the serial_number. we can fix this by calling protected instead private so that we revise the method access control so the serial_number getter is accessible to all instances of the class within the class, while still invisible from the outside.

# private methods cannot be invoked with an explicit caller (other in our example, even inside of their own class. protected methods are accessible and may be invoked with an explicit caller inside the method.
