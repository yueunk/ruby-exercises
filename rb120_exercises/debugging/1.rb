# this is my initial answer; however, implement this inside the class...

# this code initially doesn't work because we are calling #display_books on an array object; the Array class doesn't have #display_books method so we get a NoMethodError.

# since the display_books method is an instance method specific to instances of the Book class, we can call it on individual book instance. we can implement a new method in the Library class (see #display_books).
