#Using the code from the previous exercise, create an instance of Cat and assign it to a variable named kitty.
class Cat
end

kitty = Cat.new

# new info:
# instantiate a new Cat object via the class method ::new, which returns a new instance of the class, to which you can assign a variable kitty so you can make use of this new object
